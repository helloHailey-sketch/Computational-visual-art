## Introduction

This project was created as a coursework for the *Computational Visual Art and Aesthetics* course at Peking University. We focused on designing a striking, futuristic poster inspired by the unique visual style of the upcoming film *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*, which features bold colors and strong technological, sci-fi elements. Compared to the minimalistic official poster found on Maoyan, our goal was to create a more eye-catching and immersive design.

### Our Contributions

- **Logo Design:** Using logoai.com, we generated bright, futuristic logos matching the animation style. We refined them by adding Spider-Man elements and further animated them using After Effects, including a dynamic spider web version.
- **Poster Design:** We used Midjourney to generate a futuristic background, and extracted Spider-Man from the original film scenes with Segment Anything. We added dynamic effects to enhance visual impact and designed versions that change color throughout the day, inspired by Apple's dynamic wallpapers, allowing for immersive experiences when displayed on digital screens.
- **Special Editions:** We created themed posters for different audiences, including pink-themed for couples, black-and-red for "cool" visitors, black-and-white for somber moods, and explosive backgrounds for action lovers.
- **Key Visual:** We designed a vibrant main visual that captures Spider-Man’s diverse styles and artistic energy, creating a unique and memorable photo spot.
- **Easter Eggs:** Background music generated by mulbert focuses on rhythm and energy. We also used Runway to create "Everything Everywhere All at Once"-style variations, and D-ID to generate a virtual character.
